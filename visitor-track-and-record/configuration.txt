# This is a configuration notecard based on the key-value data Wizardry and Steamworks reader. 
# Everything following the "#" character is ignored along with blank lines. Values can be set for various 
# parameters in a simple and understandable format with the following syntax: 
# KEY = "VALUE" 
# Every time you change this configuration notecard, the script will reset itself and the new configuration 
# will be read from this notecard.

# The "corrade", "group" and "password" settings must correspond to your settings in Corrade.ini

# This is the UUID of the Corrade bot.
