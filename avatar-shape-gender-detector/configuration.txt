# Everything following the "#" character is ignored along with blank lines. Values can be set for various 
# parameters in a simple and understandable format with the following syntax: 
# KEY = "VALUE" 
# Every time you change this configuration notecard, the script will reset itself and the new configuration 
# will be read from this notecard.

# The "corrade", "group" and "password" settings must correspond to your settings in Corrade.ini

# This is the UUID of the Corrade bot.

# The password for the group.

# This represents the scan interval to detect avatars. Note that this script does not rescan avatars.
interval = "10"

# This represents the amount of free memory measured in bytes that the script will attempt to maintain. 
# After the memory usage of this script exceeds this amount, the script will start culling the list of 
# detected avatars in an attempt to not overflow and keep the script running.
