# This is a configuration notecard based on the key-value data Wizardry and Steamworks reader. 
# Everything following the "#" character is ignored along with blank lines. Values can be set for various 
# parameters in a simple and understandable format with the following syntax: 
# KEY = "VALUE" 
# Every time you change this configuration notecard, the script will reset itself and the new configuration 
# will be read from this notecard.

# The "corrade", "group" and "password" settings must correspond to your settings in Corrade.ini

# Set this to the UUID of the Corrade bot.
corrade = "11322b38-388a-47d0-8586-6462c4d32bd9"

# The name of the group - it can also be the UUID of the group.
group = "My Group"

# The password for the group.
password = "mypassword"
