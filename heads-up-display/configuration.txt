# This is a configuration notecard based on the key-value data Wizardry and
# Steamworks reader. Everything following the "#" character is ignored
# along with blank lines. Values can be set for various parameters in a
# simple and understandable format with the following syntax: 
# KEY =  "VALUE"
# Every time you change this configuration notecard, the script will reset
# itself and the new configuration will be read from this notecard.

# The "corrade", "group" and "password" settings must correspond to your
# settings in Corrade.ini otherwise the script will not work at all.

# Set this to the UUID of the Corrade bot.
# Corrade Resident
corrade = "4a1f4994-9fcd-491f-9abc-4f4a85142c41dsa"
